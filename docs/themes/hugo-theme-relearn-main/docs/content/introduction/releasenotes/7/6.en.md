## 7.6.0 (XXXX-XX-XX) {#7-6-0}

### New

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} The free menu configuration for the main menu area, [introduced in 7.1.0](introduction/releasenotes/7/1), is extended to the non-scolling menu header area between search box and main scrolling area using the `sidebarheadermenus` option.

  The [configuration for all sidebar menus](/configuration/sidebar/menus#defining-sidebar-menus) is similar.

  You donâ€™t need to change anything in your existing installation as the old configuration is used as a default.
